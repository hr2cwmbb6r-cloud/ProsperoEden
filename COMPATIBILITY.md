# Game compatibility

Community-maintained results for **ProsperoEden on PS5**, not desktop or Android Eden.
Last updated: **September 25, 2026**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are early, limited tests. The initial measurements came from development builds that informed v1.000.010; subsequent owner gameplay reports are identified below. Older observations are labeled below. Reaching a menu does **not** establish playable gameplay or a completed game.

## How to read the grades

- **A — Excellent:** extended gameplay tested with no significant known issues; report the tested scope. No current entry qualifies for this grade.
- **B — Good / Playable:** gameplay works in the tested sections, with some limitations. This does not imply a full playthrough.
- **C — Runs with major issues:** reaches gameplay, but speed, rendering, or stability significantly affects play.
- **D — Not playable:** fails to reach usable gameplay or has a blocking problem. This can include a game that boots.
- **Intro/menu only:** reaches an intro, title, or menu; gameplay has not been qualified.
- **Limited historical result:** an older observation without enough current-build evidence for a gameplay grade.

FPS alone does not determine the grade. A fast menu can coexist with slow or broken gameplay. Reported ranges are observed values, not guaranteed minimums or maximums unless explicitly measured that way.

## Test context and known limits

The recent development checks used **PS5 firmware 6.02 and OpenGL**. These results do not establish compatibility with other firmware or a Vulkan backend.

- **Cuphead, Horizon Chase Turbo, and Mario vs. Donkey Kong:** subsequent owner reports give B / 60 FPS, B / 50 FPS, and C / 40 FPS respectively. These are reported observations, not measured averages or guaranteed minimums; scene, mode, duration, and the specific issue behind the C grade were not supplied. Earlier Horizon menu (33–36 FPS) and Mario vs. Donkey Kong title (30 FPS) measurements refer to different test scopes.
- **Hollow Knight:** the owner confirmed gameplay, audio, controller input, and saving in earlier builds. First-use spikes and variable speed were also reported. No full-game completion or controlled sustained 60 FPS result is recorded here.
- **Jay and Silent Bob: Chronic Blunt Punch:** the owner reports grade C and 30 FPS. The specific issue, test scene, mode, and duration were not supplied; this is not a measured average or guaranteed minimum.
- **Mario Kart 8 Deluxe:** 39.50 FPS is the average over a 20-second docked gameplay window in an accepted development candidate. It is a single, unreplicated result, not an all-course average or a minimum. Stable 60 FPS remains unresolved.
- **Metroid Dread:** the owner reports playable gameplay at 40 FPS and confirmed loading after closing another game in the same app session with development fix `a9186dd`. That allocation fix is not included in the published v1.000.010 release. The FPS report is not a measured average or guaranteed minimum.
- **Horizon Chase Turbo, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Metroid Dread, and Super Mario 3D World:** recent title/menu checks showed successful return or shutdown. This does not establish repeated game switching or long-session stability.
- **Super Mario 3D World:** the owner reports that gameplay plays well after deployment of v1.000.010. Updated to Good based on that report; gameplay FPS and test duration were not provided. The earlier 35–53 FPS measurement applies only to the animated title.
- **Pokémon Legends Z-A:** slow language selection and a repeatable shutdown crash remain unresolved.
- **Summerhouse:** the owner now reports B — Playable and 25 FPS, superseding the earlier limited startup/display observation. Test scene, mode, and duration were not supplied; this is not a measured average or guaranteed minimum.
- **Animal Crossing: New Horizons:** the owner reported that the title screen and intro menus ran smoothly without issues, but once loading into island gameplay, heavy performance drops were observed with framerates settling around 15 FPS, resulting in an unstable and sluggish experience.
- **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild:** the owner reports grade D. Menu ran at ~30 FPS in both docked and handheld mode. In gameplay, FPS averaged 8–10 in both modes and assets failed to load fully — the screen appeared mostly dark with some blue elements visible — making the game unplayable.
- **Princess Peach: Showtime!:** the owner reported that the menu ran at around 10 FPS, while gameplay averaged 1–2 FPS and the game ran very slowly, making the title unplayable.
- **Pokémon Snap:** the owner reported that the game crashed, resulting in an unplayable experience.
- **Super Mario Party Jamboree:** the owner reported that the menu and gameplay both ran at around 1–2 FPS, after which the game crashed, making the title unplayable.
- **Super Mario Bros. Wonder:** the owner reported that the game crashed, resulting in an unplayable experience.
- **Pokémon Brilliant Diamond:** the owner reported that the game crashed, resulting in an unplayable experience.
- **Luigi’s Mansion 3:** the owner reported that the game crashed, resulting in an unplayable experience.
- **Super Mario 3D All-Stars:** the owner reported that the game crashed, resulting in an unplayable experience.
- **Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream:** the owner reported that the menu ran at around 10 FPS, while gameplay averaged 1–2 FPS, making the game unplayable.
- **Super Mario Odyssey:** the owner reported reaching only the intro/menu before the game crashed, preventing further gameplay testing.
- **Super Mario Maker 2:** the owner reported that the game was playable at 30 FPS, pretty smooth.
- **Mario Party Superstars:** the owner reported severe slowdowns, with some textures failing to load, resulting in an unplayable experience.
- **Pokémon FireRed & LeafGreen:** the owner reported that the game was not recognized by Prospero Eden and failed to launch, resulting in a limited historical result with no gameplay testing.


Mode was not recorded in this summary for titles other than Mario Kart; do not infer handheld or docked mode from their FPS. Repeated switching between games can still expose stability problems across the app.

## Contribute a result

**Pull requests are welcome!** Edit this file to add a game or update an existing result. Keep the table alphabetized with exactly **Game, Grade, FPS** columns; add longer context below it instead of adding columns.

In your PR, include:

- ProsperoEden version (or development commit), PS5 firmware, game version/update, and handheld or docked mode.
- Scene tested and duration: menu, gameplay, or an extended session. State whether FPS is an average, range, peak, or a rough HUD observation.
- Any rendering, audio, controller, saving, crash, or return-to-menu issues. Mention whether you tested switching games.
- A concise reproduction description and, when available, a screenshot or sanitized log supporting the result.

Do not attach games, keys, firmware, saves, or logs containing personal data. Do not copy results from other platforms into this PS5 table. Preserve conflicting results with their build/mode context until they can be reconciled.

A single Markdown table is enough for now. If the list becomes cumbersome, it can be split alphabetically while keeping this page as the index.
